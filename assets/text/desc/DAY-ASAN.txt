DAY-ASAN
DESCRIPTION:
	The Day-Asan Floating Village is a fishing community that consists of houses on wooden stilts or rock piles in shallow water and along a mangrove forest. It is fondly coined by locals as the �Little Venice of Surigao City.� Perhaps one of the reasons is that the best and fastest way you can get from one house to another is by boat, just like in Venice.
